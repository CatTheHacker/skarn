## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- The Go Language 1.7+ (https://golang.org/dl/)
- GCC on your PATH (for the https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 installation)

### Installing
- Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
- Create an application and save down the Client ID and Client Secret.
- Add a bot to the application and save down the Bot Token.
- Add the bot to the server you wish to auth this instance throuh.
- Create a directory that the server may use to store some files.
- In that directory create a `config.json`.

```json
{
	"id": "{CLIENT_ID}",
	"secret": "{CLIENT_SECRET}",
	"bot_token": "{BOT_TOKEN}",
	"server": "{SERVER_ID}",
	"members": ["{ROLE_SNOWFLAKE"],
	"admins": ["{ROLE_SNOWFLAKE"]
}
```
- It should be in the above format.
    - `"members"` is an array of role snowflakes that will be added as a member. Member can create and fill requests.
    - `"admins"` is an array of role snowflakes that will be added as an admin. Admins can adjust the amount of points each request is worth.
- Next create a file called `allowed_domains.txt` and in it place the hostnames that users may connect to the server with.
    - This does not include the port number (Even if it's not 80 or 443).
    - File must have LF line endings.
- Lastly run the following.

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/nektro/skarn
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nektro/skarn/
$ go build
```

### Running
```bash
$ ./skarn --root $homedir --port 80
```

#### Options
- `--root`
    - Path. A path to the directory Skarn can store some configuration and database files.
- `--port`
    - Integer. Port to have the Web UI listen on. Default 8000.
